I wanted to learn Go programming language so I decided to write somme tropo programs for it.

First type make ; ./sendsms

This should start a go web server locally.

In your web browser, goto: http://localhost:8080/edit/whatever.
You should see a page with phone number and message.  Fill in the information, then click send.

Also you will need to create a Tropo scripting app and make sure you have messaging token assigned (and replace it in new.go).  Your Tropo script needs 1 line really: message $msg, { :to => 'tel:+' + $to, :network => 'SMS'}
