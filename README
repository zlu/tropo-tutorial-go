I wanted to learn Go programming language so I decided to write somme tropo programs for it.

First type make ; ./sendsms

This should start a go web server locally.

In your web browser, goto: http://localhost:8080/edit/whatever.
You should see a page with phone number and message.  Fill in the information, then click send.
